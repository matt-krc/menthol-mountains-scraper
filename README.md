# Menthol Mountains Scraper

Very basic Python script using bs4 to extract all the url and image content from [Menthol Mountains](http://mentholmountains.blogspot.com/), the blog of one of the greatest songwriters of our time, David C Berman.

Berman's blog is an eclectic mix of media, including Wikipedia pages, scientific journal articles, old punk and country music videos and quotes pulled from various sources that matched the variegated interests of the man. I was initially motivated by the desire to have a collection of all these linked sources in a central place but it turned into more of a comprehensive curation project over time.

It's likely that many of the links included are dead, so future work might involve resolving those to corresponding Wayback Machine links.

The extracted data is included here in JSON as well as the script I used to create it.
